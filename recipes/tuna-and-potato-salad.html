    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a family recipe for tuna and potato salad. I have no idea if it's commonly eaten in France or if it's just a thing we ate in my family. But I know that I grew up eating it.</p>
    <p>It's very easy to prepare, and in my opinion, it's quite tasty. It's a great summer dish, but honestly, it can be eaten any time of year. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</p>
    <p><em>Serves 4 very hungry people</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>8 russet potatoes</li>
      <li>2 cans chunk light tuna, drained</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
