    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the first cheesecake I learned to make, and it has yet to let me down. It's straightforward but delicious. Sure to be a crowd pleaser, unless the crowd you're dealing with is super lame and has no taste. In which case, go find a new crowd who appreciates good things.</p>
    <p><em>Serves 8 to 12 people</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups crushed Oreos (about 18)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>3 8-oz packages softened cream cheese</li>
      <li>1 14-oz can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>2 tsps. vanilla</li>
      <li>1 cup mini chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 tsp. flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 300°F.</li>
      <li>Combine cookie crumbs and butter, pat firmly ito greased 9-inch springform pan.</li>
      <li>In mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add milk, beat until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla, mix well.</li>
      <li>In small bowl, toss together 1/2 cup chocolate chips with flour to coat, stir into cream cheese mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour mixture into prepared pan. Sprinkle remaining chips evenly over top. Bake one hour or until cake springs back when lightly touched.</li>
      <li>Cool to room temperature. Chill. Remove side of pan. Garnish as desired. Refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're looking for a version with a somewhat lower fat content, I've found that I can substitute Neufchâtel for one or two of the regular cream cheeses.</li>
      <li>Fat-free sweetened condensed milk also works just fine.</li>
      <li>I like to put a large baking dish of water in the oven on a rack below the one the cheesecake is baking on, as the steam generated may help to reduce the risk of cracks in the finished cheesecake. Alternatively, you can cover the bottom and sides of the pan with foil and place the cheesecake in the oven on top of a baking sheet, and gently pour water onto the baking sheet to coat the bottom of it.</li>
    </ul>
